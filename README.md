# Subsocial Flutter SDK

## Usage

In your flutter project run the following commands to add the SDK to your project as a package.

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-flutter.git packages/subsocial_sdk
```

then run the following command

```bash
./packages/subsocial_sdk/init.py
```

in your flutter project in `pubspec.yml` just add:

```yaml
subsocial_sdk:
    path: packages/subsocial_sdk
```

then use the SDK as any other flutter package.

**To Update the SDK**
Simply run:

```bash
git submodule foreach git pull origin main
```

then rerun the `init.py` script to fetch the latest native libs.

```bash
./packages/subsocial_sdk/init.py
```

**To use a prerelese version of the SDK**

then run the following command

```bash
./packages/subsocial_sdk/init.py --dev
```
it will also print the tag/release of this prerelese
so make sure to switch the git module to that branch too.

```bash
cd ./packages/subsocial_sdk
git checkout RELEASE_NAME_HERE
cd ..
# Then add + commit your changes
# and then just run
git submodule update --recursive
```

## To run the example app
Run the following script

```bash
./init.py .
```
